  About
</h1>
<p>
Writlet is the online application for letter writing!
</p>
  <h3>Why</h3>
  <p>
    We at Writlet believe that the current forms of social media are too fast (instant), <br>
    this makes messages lose their value.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore we created this application. An online writing simulator without the hassles of actually writing, <br>
    but with the benefits!
    <br>
  </p>

  <h3>How</h3>
  <p>
    Register an account, <br>
    Find your penpals, <br>
    Write and receive letters!
